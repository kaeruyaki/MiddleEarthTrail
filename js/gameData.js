Nestled at its foot is the ancient village of Bree, a strange and bustling place of Big Folk and Hobbits alike. You pass under the great arch of the town-gate, pulling your cloak a little tighter. The Prancing Pony inn spills warm light and noise into the night, a welcome sight for tired travelers, but the faces you see are grim and suspicious. This is the first great test of your quest: to find a wizard in a town full of strangers, with the Enemy's servants already hunting for you.`, locationType: 'town' },

A great ruin of a watchtower stands on its summit, a broken crown against a grey sky. From this vantage, you can see the road you have traveled stretching back for miles, a thin ribbon in the wilderness. There is a commanding view of the lands all about, but the feeling is not one of safety. It is one of exposure. This high place feels watched, and as dusk begins to fall, you sense that you are not alone.` },
    'trollshaws': { name: "Trollshaws", x: 350, y: 355, distance: 175, legName: "The Road to Rivendell", next: 'rivendell', locationType: 'wild', description: `You stumble into a clearing and stop dead. There, hulking and monstrous, are the three Stone-Trolls, forever frozen in their foolish argument by the rising sun decades ago. Moss grows on their stony limbs and a bird has made a nest in one's ear. It is a scene straight out of Bilbo's wildest tales, a stark and chilling reminder that the world outside the Shire has always been filled with creatures of nightmare. Seeing them, solid and real, makes the threat of your own journey feel all the more present.` },

Just as you feel your strength failing, you descend into a hidden valley where the air grows sweet with the scent of pine. The sound of waterfalls echoes from the steep, wooded slopes, and you see the lights of a house deep in the valley's fold. This is Imladris, the Last Homely House East of the Sea. You are brought before its lord, Elrond, master of lore and a bastion against the shadow for ages uncounted. His face is ageless and kind, yet his eyes hold the memory of the world's great sorrows. He looks upon your pale face with concern. "You are fading," Elrond says gravely. "You have been touched by the shadow. You must be tended to at once."`, locationType: 'town' },

As you climb higher, the air grows thin and a cruel wind howls like a hunting wolf. A sudden, unnatural snowstorm descends, a blinding, swirling wall of white that stings your face and freezes the breath in your lungs. It is more than mere weather; you can feel a malevolent will behind the storm, a fell voice on the wind, seeking to crush you and your quest before it can even cross the Misty Mountains.` },

The only sound is the ragged panting of your companions. Gandalf's staff illuminates a vast, empty hall, the first of many. The air is cold and dead, heavy with the dust of ages and a deep, abiding sorrow. This is the great delving of the Dwarves, Khazad-d没m, and you are trespassers in a city of ghosts. The journey ahead lies not under the sky, but in the black heart of the earth.`, locationType: 'wild' },
    'lothlorien': { name: "Lothl贸rien", x: 520, y: 480, distance: 550, legName: "The Great River", next: 'anduin', locationType: 'wild', description: `You stumble out of the East-gate of Moria, grief-stricken and leaderless, into a dim wood. The trees here are unlike any you have ever seen, with silver bark and leaves of gold that never seem to fall. The air is clear and light, and a strange peace begins to settle over your weary heart, washing away the filth and terror of the deep places. You have come to the Golden Wood of Lothl贸rien, the hidden heart of Elvendom on earth, and for a time, you are safe.` },
    'anduin': { name: "Anduin River", x: 550, y: 550, distance: 650, legName: "The Breaking of the Fellowship", next: 'amonhen', locationType: 'wild', description: `The great river Anduin carries you swiftly south. The banks are empty and wild, but you cannot shake the feeling of being watched. At night, you see a log floating in your wake, always keeping pace, and sometimes you glimpse two pale, luminous eyes in the dark. It is Gollum, drawn by the Ring. His presence is a constant, unsettling reminder of what the Ring can do, of the wretched end that awaits those who carry it for too long. The burden on your own neck feels heavier each day.` },
    'amonhen': { name: "Amon Hen", x: 560, y: 600, distance: 700, legName: "The Emyn Muil", next: 'emynmuil', locationType: 'wild', description: `You land at the foot of Amon Hen, the Hill of Seeing. A path leads up its wooded slope to the summit, where the ancient kings of Gondor would gaze out upon their realm. But there is no sense of majesty here now, only one of impending doom. The Fellowship is strained, divided by the corrupting whispers of the Ring. Boromir's eyes linger on you, filled with a strange fire. You know in your heart that a decision must be made. The path of the Fellowship may end here.` },
    'emynmuil': { name: "Emyn Muil", x: 600, y: 620, distance: 750, legName: "The Dead Marshes", next: 'deadmarshes', locationType: 'wild', description: `The Fellowship is broken. Now it is just you and Sam, alone in the treacherous hills of the Emyn Muil. It is a maze of razor-sharp rocks and deep chasms, a desolate landscape that mirrors the despair in your heart. Every step is a struggle, and the weight of your task is matched only by the physical weight of the Ring, which seems to grow heavier with every mile you travel deeper into the shadow of Mordor.` },
    'deadmarshes': { name: "Dead Marshes", x: 680, y: 610, distance: 800, legName: "To the Black Gate", next: 'blackgate', locationType: 'wild', description: `The stench of decay hangs heavy over the endless pools and mires of the Dead Marshes. A faint, ghostly light flickers beneath the surface of the stagnant water, and as you look closer, you see them: the pale, dead faces of Elves and Men and Orcs, forever trapped in their watery graves from a battle fought an age ago. Their eyes seem to follow you as you pick your way along the treacherous path, a chilling vision of the fate that awaits all who fight and fall in this blighted land.` },
    'blackgate': { name: "The Black Gate", x: 750, y: 600, distance: 900, next: null, locationType: 'wild', description: `After a long and weary journey through the slag-hills and choking dust of the Desolation of the Morannon, you see it. The Black Gate of Mordor. Two vast towers of iron and rock stand like fangs, between which a great wall of iron bars hangs, impassable and grim. The air crackles with watchfulness, and the ground trembles with the unseen industry of the Dark Lord. There is no hope of passing this way. Your quest seems doomed to fail at the very threshold of the enemy's land.` },
    'cirithungol': { name: "Cirith Ungol", x: 780, y: 650, distance: 950, legName: "The Land of Shadow", next: 'mountdoom', locationType: 'wild', description: `Gollum has led you to a secret path, a steep and winding stair carved into the black rock of the mountains. But as you climb, the air grows thick and foul with a stench of ancient malice. You come to the entrance of a tunnel, a black hole that seems to drink the very light. An unspeakable dread emanates from it, a sense of patient, hungry evil that has nested here for ages. This is Torech Ungol, the lair of Shelob.` },
    'mountdoom': { name: "Mount Doom", x: 850, y: 630, distance: 1000, type: 'end', locationType: 'wild', description: `You are there. At the end of all things. The sky above is a roiling storm of black and red, lit by the angry glow of Orodruin. The very air is a choking ash that burns your lungs, and the ground beneath your feet is hot and cracked. The Ring on its chain is a searing weight, a torment of fire against your chest, screaming for you to claim it, to turn back from the precipice. Before you is a dark opening, the Sammath Naur, the Crack of Doom. The end of your quest is at hand.` }
